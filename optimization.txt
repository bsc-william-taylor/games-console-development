What I did:
First I went through and inline'd all the functions that I could. I also turned any functions that I could (like std::min/std::max) into macros, so there was even less function overhead.

Then I made some of the stuff simd. In sobel.cpp, there were some matrices which I made simd in order to have some speedup.

In image.cpp, where the image is written to file, I made the actual writing to file simd, to try and get a speedup.

In a last attempt to get speedup, which probably did nothing, I removed some uses of std::vector and replaced with stack-arrays.
